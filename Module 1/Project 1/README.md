## Project Descrption
We will  build a simple black game using Python, a dealer vs a player. 

## Rules
The values for all the cards dealt to a player are added and if the sum exceeds 21, the player busts and loses instantly. If a player gets an exact 21, the player wins against the dealer. Otherwise, in order to win, the sum of the player's cards must be more than the sum of the dealer's cards.

## Workflow
Step 1: Imports and Global Variables
Step 2: Create a Card Class
Step 3: Create a Deck Class
Step 4: Create a Hand Class
Step 5: Write a function for taking hits
Step 6: Write a function prompting the Player to Hit or Stand
Step 7: Write functions to display cards
Step 8: Write functions to handle end of game scenarios

## Organization
We used Jira to organise our work.
